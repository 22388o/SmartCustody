# Sparrow (version 1.5.5)
### A #SmartCustody Case Study

Sparrow is a desktop wallet.

## Usage

To most closely cleave to Gordian designs and principles, Blockchain Commons suggests the use of Sparrow as a [transaction coordinator](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/Docs/Integration.md#using-sparrow-as-a-transaction-coordinator), which allows the usage of the [Gordian architecture](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#overview-gordian-architectural-model). Keys are maintained on closely held devices, while Sparrow acts as a watch-only wallet that then requests signatures from those devices as requires. In this scheme, Sparrow usage occurs as follows:

1. Keys are generated on closely held devices.
2. A single-sig or multisig wallet is created on Sparrow.
3. Keys are imported into Sparrow as required.
4. Transactions are generated by Sparrow as PSBTs.
5. Transactions are signed by closely held devices as needed.
6. Transactions are returned to Sparrow as a fully signed PSBT and then transmitted.

This is not the only possible usage for Sparrow, as it's a fully functional desktop wallet. Keys can also be generated and/or held by Sparrow itself, adding notable Convenience, but doing so also decreases the resilience of the wallet, potentially opening it up to compromise.

## Gordian Principles

The following discussion of how Sparrow meets [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles) largely refers to the scenario above. See "Other Scenarios", below, for additional notes on other usages.

### Independence

Sparrow maximizes independence in all scenarios because it gives users almost total control over where seeds come from and how they're used, as well as how Sparrow operates with the Bitcoin network.

**Pros:**

* Users can choose to create seeds or import them from a wide variety of hardware, airgapped, or software wallets.
* Users can choose to sign transactions directly in Sparrow or to hand them off to another device.
* Users can choose to connect to the Bitcoin network via one of several public servers, via a specified Bitcoin Core Server, or via a Private Electrum server.

**Neutral:**

* The number of choices available through Sparrow can be overwhelming, and users may not know which create optimal security.
