# #SmartCustody Case Studies

The following case studies discuss how a variety of hardware and software wallets address what Blockchain Commons advocates as principles for self-sovereign wallet design and how they respond to a variety of adversaries identified by #SmartCustody risk-modeling.

* Blockchain Commons Seed Tool (TBD)
* Foundation Devices Passport (TBD)
* Keystone Pro (TBD)
* Sparrow Bitcoin Wallet (TBD)

## Gordian Principles

The [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles) are independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. They together outline a self-sovereign methodology for the management of cryptocurrency, where a user stays in control of their digital assets and can easily transfer them, but simultaneously has good protections from the loss of funds that can arise from carelessness. 

Each Case Study measures how the device advances the four Gordian Principles or succumbs to their dangers.

### Gordian Architecture

Blockchain Commons has advanced an [architectural model](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#overview-gordian-architectural-model) that we support as a best practice to advance the Gordian Principles. It supports the Gordian Principles by suggesting a partitioned architecture where data and services are isolated from each other, only connected by airgaps or torgaps. One of the preferred architectures for wallet design has seed holders physically isolated from the network, using QR codes transmitted by cameras to grant a networked transaction coordinators pubkeys to create a wallet and then signing PSBTs using that same method. We consider this the second generation of wallet design, forming the first generation of connected hardware wallets such as Ledger and Trezor. All of the wallets studied here can be used in that configuration.
